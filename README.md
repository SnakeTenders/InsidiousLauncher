# Insidious Launcher 1.0
It seems you have stumbled upon the official InsidiousRP Launcher!
Full disclosure: I'm not artistic or creative ðŸ˜•

### Installation:
Installing this launcher is easy as no-bake cookies.
All you have to do is this:
- Click the green "Code" button, then select "Download Zip."
- Extract the zip file to any directory of your choosing, but remember to keep the files together!
- (Optional) Right cluck the Insidious.exe file and select "Send To" > "Desktop" for a shortcut you can move anywhere in your computer!

And that's all there is to it! Happy gaming!

PS: Please update when updates are available, I don't want to force them. ðŸ˜Š
